## Outline
In this workshop, we will:

- Introduce version control and explain why it's important
- Introduce Git and Github
- Demonstrate using Git / Github

## What is version control

- Tracking changes in code
- Sharing and managing those changes with others
- Reverting code when errors are introduced

</div>

## Your project needs version control

<div class="columns-2">
- You document all your benchwork in a lab notebook (right?). Code is the 
"Methods" section of your project for bioinformatics analysis. 
- Code can be overwritten, deleted, modified. This should be tracked so it can 
be
  - reused
  - shared
  - improved

## Version control with Git

 * Created by Linus Torvalds (of Linux fame) in 2005
 * Designed to track changes in a project and sync changes
 * Key terms:
     * Repository
     * Local
     * Remote
     * Branch
     * Commit
     * Clone
     * Push
     * Pull

## Initiating a git repository

There are two ways to initiate a Git repository:

  * On a remote server (e.g. GitHub)
  * Locally using `git init`
  
`.gitignore` file

  * Tells `git` not to track certain files that match various patterns
  * Useful when creating large numbers of data files that are not code
  
`git` creates an internal `.git` folder.

Other folders you might want to generate when creating your repository:

  * `src/` - for code files
  * `metadata/` - for storing machine- and human-readable files (I like *.csv)
  * `docs` - for documentation, reports, 
  * `data` - for data files generated by your code that you want hosted (or for internal use)
  
## GitHub

GitHub (https://www.github.com) is a large online database of git repositories

  * Can serve as a remote repository for your project
  * Is free to use for most people, but service is limited on the free tier
  * Includes features like issue tracking, releases, and others
  * Very useful for collaborating with other developers and the community
  
Other, similar tools include:

  * GitLab
  * BitBucket (Atlassian)
  
## Live Demonstration!

Having just generated a single-cell dataset, we'd like to start processing. To
start, lets document our samples, and track our changes using `git`.
